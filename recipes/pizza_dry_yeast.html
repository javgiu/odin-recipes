        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Versatile pizza dough, excellent for preparing Neapolitan pizza, calzone and any other kind of pizza</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>500 g (100%) <b>"00" Flour</b> or Bread Flour</li>
                <li>350 g (70%) water</li>
                <li>Pinch (1-2 g) of dry yeast</li>
                <li>15 g (3%) salt</li>
            </ul>

            <p><em>The percentages are based on the total flour</em></p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Add the flour and salt to a bowl. Mix the yeast with the water until it dissolves completely. Add the water and yeast to the bowl with the rest of the ingredients and mix until there is no dry flour left.</li>
                <li>Cover the bowl with a nylon and let it rest for 10 minutes and then, with wet hands, fold the dough over itself inside the bowl until it tightens and forms a ball. Repeat this step until the dough is completely smooth.</li>
                <li>Let the dough rest in the refrigerator (5 degrees Celsius) for a minimum of 18 hours, covered with a nylon. After this time the dough is ready to be divided into two individual doughs of approximately 300 g.</li>
                <li>Remove the dough from the refrigerator, divide it, stretch it into two small balls and let them ferment for about 2 or 3 hours in a small container sprinkled with flour or semolina.</li>
                <li>Your pizza dough is ready to bake. Add the ingredients of your choice and bake at 450 degrees Fahrenheit for 12 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
