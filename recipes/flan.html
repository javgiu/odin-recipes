        <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Enjoy the traditional Cuban flan. A sweet treat that takes every Cuban back to their childhood. <em>Easy to make</em>, you only need eggs, sugar and milk to create this wonder.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
                <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Melt sugar in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat until liquefied and golden in color. Carefully pour hot syrup into a deep 9-inch round glass baking dish, turning the dish to evenly coat the bottom; set aside.</li>
                <li>Beat eggs in a large bowl. Add condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla; beat until smooth. Pour egg mixture on top of caramel in the baking dish; place in a deep roasting pan. Carefully pour in enough hot water to come 1 inch up the sides of the dish.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until just set with a slight jiggle in the center, about 1 hour, checking after 55 minutes. Keep in mind the flan will continue to set as it cools. Remove from the oven and carefully transfer baking dish to a wire rack; cool to room temperature, then cover with plastic wrap to prevent a skin forming. Refrigerate for 3 hours or up to 3 days.</li>
                <li>To serve, run a knife around the edges of the dish; carefully invert onto a rimmed serving plate and let caramel sauce flow over flan.</li>
            </ol>
